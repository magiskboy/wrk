Overview

  wrk should build on most UNIX-like operating systems and
  architectures that have GNU make and are supported by LuaJIT and
  OpenSSL. Some systems may require additional CFLAGS or LDFLAGS,
  see the top of the Makefile for examples

  In many cases simply running `make` (often `gmake` on *BSD) will
  do the trick.

Dependencies

  wrk requires OpenSSL and is distributed with appropriate
  versions that will be unpacked and built as necessary.

  If you are building wrk packages for an OS distribution or otherwise
  prefer to use system versions of dependencies you may specify their
  location when invoking make with one or more of:

    WITH_OPENSSL

  Or to use the Homebrew version of OpenSSL on Mac OS X:

    make WITH_OPENSSL=/usr/local/opt/openssl
